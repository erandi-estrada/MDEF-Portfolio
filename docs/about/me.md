# Erandi Estrada

I’m an industrial designer passionate about how **technology, materials, and human experience** come together to create meaningful design. My work explores the balance between **craft and innovation**, from handmade processes to digital fabrication.

I’m currently studying the *Master in Design for Emergent Futures* at IAAC and Fab Lab Barcelona, where I’m expanding my practice toward more sustainable, experimental, and human-centred approaches. My projects often explore themes like **modularity, wellbeing, and social connection**, while combining research, prototyping, and storytelling.

I love challenges that require both creativity and strategy — from designing lifestyle objects and lighting to developing speculative and systemic design concepts.

**Focus areas:** sustainable design · material exploration · product development · design research · experience design

**Tools & skills:** Adobe Creative Suite · Rhinoceros · Fusion 360 · SolidWorks · CNC / laser cutting / 3D printing · collaborative design methods
