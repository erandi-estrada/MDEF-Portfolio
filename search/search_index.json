To be judge \u00b6 We played a game of surveillance, half of us became subjects, half became detectives. For thirty minutes, I was followed without knowing by whom, and for another thirty, I became the one who watched. The constant awareness of being seen changed the way I moved, the way I existed. Subject My prototype was my own hair. I usually keep it tied with a hair clip, but this time I let it loose, it became my prosthesis, my shield. The idea of someone following me made me feel anxious, so hiding from my own Detective behind myself seemed like the only thing I could control. The surveillance started at 12:17. Some of us went to the rooftop, but the sun was too bright so after a few minutes I went downstairs, trying to shake off the feeling of being observed. My original plan was to stay still, to be boring and pretend it was a normal day, but the discomfort pushed me to move. So I ran away from my detective and wandered without direction, not knowing where to go. By 12:40, I returned to IAAC and ran into Ale and Aishwarya. We walked together toward the coffee shop and then back to the classroom. Even though I know my phone listens, that cameras watch from every corner, that I'm theoretically being observed all the time, knowing that someone was actually following me was completely different. It made the abstract fear tangible. I felt panic rise in moments I couldn't explain, and even after I lost my Detective, I couldn't shake the feeling of being pursued. Detective As the detective, I tried to be discreet, to observe without being noticed, but quickly realized it was harder than I imagined. At 13:02, the subject was deeply focused on the computer with Armin, likely working on something related to the webpage. By 13:11, the subject closed the laptop, returned to her seat, and put some items in her locker. At 13:12, she went downstairs, and I immediately lost track of her. I walked around the building and the surrounding areas, trying to find her again without being noticed, but she seemed to have disappeared for a while. Since the subject suggested continuing the game, I followed once more. At 14:01, she joined a group on the terrace with Ayal, Max, and Armin, excited to try a new game of Armin's. She ate some pasta, and throughout those moments, she shared music, recommending \"Cosa sar\u00e0\" for sad moments, \"Cumbia japonesa\" for cooking, \"Ella baila sola\" for parties, and choosing bossa nova to manage stress, even though she confessed she would have preferred techno. Each song revealed a different version of the subject, a small window into her moods, habits, and how she navigates everyday life. Trying not to be obvious, I attempted to stay discreet, but the subject quickly realized I was the one following her. Once I lost track of her, I had to ask around and search through her nearby circle to try to find her, which made it clear that discretion alone was ineffective. The exercise showed how challenging it is to be a silent observer, and how quickly the balance of watching can shift, revealing both the watcher and the watched. #eye-emoji { position: fixed; font-size: 40px; z-index: 10000; pointer-events: none; opacity: 1; padding: 5px; } /* Estilo para los enlaces */ a { color: #1976d2; text-decoration: none; } a:hover { text-decoration: underline; } document.addEventListener('mousemove', function(e) { let eye = document.getElementById('eye-emoji'); if (!eye) { eye = document.createElement('div'); eye.id = 'eye-emoji'; eye.textContent = '\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f'; document.body.appendChild(eye); } eye.style.left = (e.clientX - 20) + 'px'; eye.style.top = (e.clientY - 20) + 'px'; });","title":"Prosthesis"},{"location":"Prosthesis/Prosthesis/#becoming-prosthetic","text":"To be the best version of ourselves once sounded like an act of progress, a cleaner, faster, optimized human.

Personal Introduction \u00b6 This forensic analysis looks inside a 2009 Apple MacBook to understand how it was built and why it stopped working. What we found was surprising - computers from this time were made very differently from today's models. They had more ports, more parts you could replace, and were easier to repair. We think the main reason it failed was a swollen battery, but it was also made obsolete by newer software and technology. The most surprising discovery was that even though the laptop seemed completely broken, the hard drive still worked perfectly. We were able to recover all the personal files and information from it, which shows how important it is to properly erase devices before throwing them away.

The MacBook is a portable computing device designed to process information, display visual output, and allow users to interact with digital content through its screen, keyboard, camera, trackpad, and built-in media and connectivity ports. How does it work? Mechanical: The MacBook\u2019s mechanical systems support and protect its internal components. The hinge allows the screen to open and close, the keyboard uses pressure switches to register input, the trackpad uses a rigid surface over a sensor layer, and the cooling system uses a fan and to move heat away from the processor. The case holds all components in alignment and enables physical interaction. Electrical: The MacBook operates through interconnected electrical systems. Power flows from the battery and power adapter through voltage regulators to the logic board, where circuits distribute energy to the CPU, memory, storage, display, and other parts of the computer. Electrical signals move between components via buses, connectors, and wiring, enabling communication between sensors, input devices, and processing hardware. Digital: Digital operation is handled by firmware and software that translate user actions into computational tasks. The operating system coordinates memory, processes input, manages storage, and controls the display. Embedded controllers interpret keyboard and trackpad signals, while system firmware initializes hardware and manages low-level logic. Together, these digital layers enable the MacBook to run applications, process data, and execute user commands. Construction & Failure How is it built? The MacBook is assembled primarily with small screws that secure a plastic top and bottom cases to an internal frame. The top case integrates the keyboard and trackpad as a single unit mounted above the main internal components. Inside, beneath the keyboard and trackpad, are the optical drive, battery, RAM modules, fan, and hard-drive bay. The lowest layer contains the logic board, wireless cards, and the cooling system, with everything connected through cables and board-to-board connectors. The logic board also holds all external input/output ports, such as USB, audio, Ethernet, power, and video-out, which are accessible along the side of the chassis. The display assembly consists of the LCD panel, backlight, camera module, and wiring harness enclosed within the lid. This assembly is wired to the logic board through the edges of the computer, which was incredibly frustrating to remove without breaking it. Why did it fail? Our best guess is that the computer became obsolete because the batteries stopped working. We weren\u2019t able to get a power cable to try charging it, but when we separated the battery from the computer, we noticed it was slightly swollen. We decided to open it to check the components, and it turned out that only 1 of the 6 cells was swollen. We tried measuring the voltage with a multimeter and, as expected, the cells were no longer functioning. We also found a lot of lint and dust inside the computer, which may have contributed to a decrease in performance. Component Testing \u00b6 Hard Drive Recovery \u00b6 WHY To explore data recovery possibilities and demonstrate how much personal information remains accessible on discarded devices, highlighting digital security concerns. HOW Connected the 160GB Fujitsu hard drive to a modern Apple laptop via external adapter, successfully accessing stored data including personal files and user information. RESULT Successfully recovered data, identifying the original owner. This revealed significant privacy implications of improper device disposal. Fan Control Hack \u00b6 WHY To understand motor control and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) principles while repurposing a functional component. HOW Used Barduino board with Arduino IDE, requiring pin extraction, transistor integration, and custom wiring to achieve variable speed control. RESULT Successfully controlled fan speed through Arduino code after overcoming wiring challenges and voltage requirements. Trackpad Conversion Attempt \u00b6 WHY To convert the MacBook trackpad into an USB USB trackpad, exploring component repurposing. HOW Followed online tutorials to identify pins and solder USB cable directly to the trackpad board. RESULT Despite proper soldering, the trackpad wasn't recognized by computers. Provided valuable soldering practice and component understanding. Display Screen Testing \u00b6 WHY Despite knowing through research and advice from instructors that the display screen would be relatively difficult to hack into, we still wanted to give it a try since it was one of the components we were most excited about its potential. HOW We started by trying to connect the inverter board to a power source to attempt to light up the screen. The inverter board converts low-voltage DC to high-voltage AC, provides constant current to the CCFL tube and controls on/off and brightness. We discovered the screen uses Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp (CCFL) not LED, so the inverter board had 4 identical wires for GND, power input, BL_ENABLE (on/off), and BL_DIM (brightness) which needed 2 power supplies and trial to identify which wire is for which. RESULT After connecting the inverter to the power source we tried every cable with 12V, but unfortunately it didn't turn on. The complexity of CCFL technology and the specific voltage requirements made this component particularly challenging to reactivate. Technical Findings \u00b6 Key Discoveries Motors Identified Cooling fan DC brushless motor Hard drive spindle motor Hard drive precision stepper motor DVD drive mechanism motors Sensors Found Microphones (sound) Trackpad multi-touch surface iSight camera Wi-Fi + Bluetooth modules Hall effect lid sensor Temperature sensors Sudden Motion Sensor (in HDD) Team Reflections \u00b6 What We Learned The disassembly process revealed how much more complex the internal architecture of a MacBook laptop is compared to what is visible to our eyes from the outside. From the large number of screws that are used to secure the casing to the intricate breakdown of each part into even smaller sub-components, the level of engineering detail became apparent. Despite Apple marketing itself as user friendly and intuitive, the internal composition of their devices proves otherwise. Through this process, we gained a deeper understanding of the relative 'hackability' of different components of a MacBook and the range of techniques that can enable certain parts to be controlled or manipulated for reuse, including coding, computing, soldering, and other techniques. What Surprised Us \"I had no idea how many screws were inside my computer. So. Many. Screws.\" - Ayal \"Interesting how small technology can be, with high capacity.\" - Ivan \"The number of components packed inside the computer was surprising. Computers used to be thicker and had more ports and connectors. Now, I\u2019m really curious to see a modern computer to compare how they have evolved.\" -Erandi \"A deceptively complex internal structure compared to the user-friendly interface.\" - Heba Documentation & References \u00b6 Component Datasheets HDD Hard Drive Technical Documentation DC Brushless Fan Control Specifications References Apple Inc.

Your browser does not support the video tag. This project investigates how beauty, order, and cleanliness in Barcelona's public space often rely on quiet forms of exclusion. Through walking as a method, mapping, filming, and embodied interventions, I explore how design regulates who may rest, who may appear, and what forms of life are allowed to exist. What looks \"beautiful\" frequently hides a subtle violence. Methodology How Walking became my primary method of inquiry. I explored the city through 1PP (first-person perspective) documentation, using my body, my phone, and direct sensory observation as tools for detecting exclusion. I photographed, filmed, and paused in spaces where beauty, order, and hostility intersect. Every time I encountered spikes, barriers, anti-rest benches, or decorative nature trapped in controlled formats, I documented them and added the location to a shared map. This systematic process resulted in a detailed map of hostile design across Barcelona, built through repeated walks and embodied encounters. The map served both as a research log and as a spatial portrait of the city's politics of beauty. Where My walks focused on the central areas of Barcelona where tourism, circulation, and urban aesthetics collide. I moved through La Rambla, Parc de la Ciutadella, nearby plazas, pedestrian streets, and the surrounding commercial corridors, spaces where beauty is carefully staged and where the pressure to maintain a \"clean\" and orderly image is strongest. These are the places where hostile design appears most intensely: at the entrances of hotels and restaurants, along busy sidewalks, around benches and resting points, and in spots where people and non-human species are subtly discouraged from stopping. Why Hostile design hides in plain sight. It becomes invisible precisely because it is normalized as \"maintenance,\" \"cleanliness,\" or \"urban order.\" Walking the city allowed me to sense this violence not as a concept but as an experience: through discomfort, interruption, proximity, and embodied friction. Mapping the findings made visible a network of micro-violences that collectively shape who may rest, who may appear, and which forms of life the city is willing to host. \u276e \u276f let slideIndex = 1; showSlides(slideIndex); function plusSlides(n) { showSlides(slideIndex += n); } function currentSlide(n) { showSlides(slideIndex = n); } function showSlides(n) { let i; let slides = document.getElementsByClassName(\"slide\"); let dots = document.getElementsByClassName(\"dot\"); if (n > slides.length) {slideIndex = 1} if (n < 1) {slideIndex = slides.length} for (i = 0; i < slides.length; i++) { slides[i].style.display = \"none\"; } for (i = 0; i < dots.length; i++) { dots[i].className = dots[i].className.replace(\" active\", \"\"); } slides[slideIndex-1].style.display = \"block\"; dots[slideIndex-1].className += \" active\"; } // Auto-advance every 5 seconds setInterval(() => { plusSlides(1); }, 5000); .slide { display: none; } .dot { cursor: pointer; height: 10px; width: 10px; margin: 0 4px; background-color: #bbb; border-radius: 50%; display: inline-block; transition: background-color 0.3s ease; } .dot.active, .dot:hover { background-color: #fff; } .prev:hover, .next:hover { background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.7) !important; } Manifesto: Beauty as Violence Beauty has become a form of control. Our public spaces perform perfection while silencing life. They are stage sets, not ecosystems. Benches deny rest, walls erase voices, and spikes replace sanctuary.This is not design for people; it is design against life. It decides who belongs, and who must disappear. It declares what is clean by violently excluding what it calls dirty. Therefore, we must see this order for what it is: violence disguised as aesthetics. If beauty requires exclusion, then it is not beauty. It is a system of exclusion. Comfort for a few always requires discomfort for the many. Conceptual Definition Urban beauty often appears neutral: clean lines, polished surfaces, controlled vegetation. However, this project argues that such beauty operates as a system of exclusion. In Barcelona, benches, facades, and even landscaping participate in a spatial order that determines who may sit, pause, appear, or exist. Violence here is subtle: not physical force, but the systematic removal of discomfort, disorder, and \"undesired\" beings, humans, plants or birds. This work intervenes in those silent boundaries. Through embodied actions, I test what happens when the excluded returns: a body resting where it shouldn't, a plant growing where it isn't allowed, a person wearing the hostile architecture meant to repel them. The objective is not to fix the city, but to reveal its underlying logic: beauty as discipline, and life as resistance. Action 1: The Prohibited Rest Hypothesis If beauty operates through the denial of rest, then placing my body in spaces designed to repel it will reveal how comfort and exclusion are distributed. Prototype I attempted to rest for 10 minutes on surfaces modified with spikes designed to prevent people from sitting. I documented the action through time-lapse videos and notes written immediately afterward. WHY To expose how public space quietly discourages rest by transforming design into a mechanism of control. By placing my body in spaces intentionally made uncomfortable, I test how beauty operates as a disciplinary tool that sanitizes the city by removing undesired presence. WHERE Ledges with spikes and other anti-rest modifications found outside hotels, shops, and restaurants, areas where maintaining a \"clean\" and orderly image is prioritized for customers and tourists. These sites make visible how private commercial interests shape the public experience of the city. HOW I sit for a fixed period of 10 minutes in each location, placing my body in direct friction with surfaces designed to repel it. I document the action using time-lapse video and photographs, observing both my own discomfort and the reactions, often indifference, of passersby. My body becomes a temporary disruption in a space optimized for circulation, not rest. PROTOCOL \u2014 Action 1: The Prohibited Rest 1. Site Selection (strategic choice) Choose locations where hostile design is used to expel both humans and nonhuman life. In this action, the focus is on: Ledges and surfaces with spikes for people (anti-rest architecture) Edges and structures with spikes for pigeons (anti-animal architecture) Places where both types of spikes coexist Sites with high visibility and continuous flow of people Selected areas: La Rambla (tourist corridor, high circulation) Parc de la Ciutadella (public leisure space) Plazas and busy intersections Entrances of hotels, shops, and restaurants that prioritize \"clean image\" These locations maximize friction between \"beauty,\" control, and everyday behavior. 2. Pre-Observation (context study) Before sitting, visit each site to observe: How people move through the space Whether anyone uses the surface despite the spikes How spikes are incorporated into the aesthetic of the building How human and nonhuman presence is regulated Note mentally how the architecture shapes acceptable behavior. 3. Preparation (logistics + documentation) Wear neutral clothing to avoid performing a character Choose a discreet angle to place the phone for time-lapse recording Identify exact spots where spikes are present Decide on a fixed duration: 10 minutes per site Plan to write reflections immediately after each action No notebooks, props, or conspicuous recording tools 4. Action Implementation (embodied presence) Sit directly on or beside surfaces where spikes are installed Keep a relaxed, natural posture, simply be there Remain in place for 10 minutes, regardless of discomfort Do not engage with passersby unless approached Let the body become the site of tension between design and presence 5. Documentation (strategic) Time-lapse video capturing your presence in a hostile space Close-up photos of spikes intended for humans and pigeons Wide shots of the site to contextualize its beauty/performance Quick field notes after each action (written in your phone): Emotional reactions Physical discomfort Social reactions (glances, avoidance, indifference) Environmental context (noise, flow, weather) All documentation focuses on revealing the contrast between beauty and exclusion. 6. Post-Action Reflection (after the site visit) Guiding questions: Did anyone notice or react? How? Did the discomfort remain invisible to most people? How does hostility hide behind \"cleanliness\"? What forms of exclusion remain unquestioned in daily life? What did the spikes communicate about who belongs in that space? Reflect on how violence can be aesthetic, normalized, and unnoticed. 7. Reflection Very few people noticed me. Most walked past indifferently, as if my presence didn't belong or wasn't worth registering. When someone did look, it was quickly, more confusion than concern. The architecture succeeded: I felt out of place. My presence revealed that hostility does not need enforcement; design performs its own violence quietly. \u2190 Previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Next \u2192 let protocolIndex = 1; showProtocol(protocolIndex); function plusProtocol(n) { showProtocol(protocolIndex += n); } function currentProtocol(n) { showProtocol(protocolIndex = n); } function showProtocol(n) { let i; let cards = document.getElementsByClassName(\"protocol-card\"); let dots = document.getElementsByClassName(\"protocol-dot\"); if (n > cards.length) {protocolIndex = 1} if (n < 1) {protocolIndex = cards.length} for (i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) { cards[i].style.display = \"none\"; } for (i = 0; i < dots.length; i++) { dots[i].className = dots[i].className.replace(\" active\", \"\"); } cards[protocolIndex-1].style.display = \"block\"; dots[protocolIndex-1].className += \" active\"; } .protocol-card { display: none; padding: 2rem; background: white; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border: 1px solid #e1e4e8; } .protocol-card.active { display: block; } .protocol-dot { cursor: pointer; height: 12px; width: 12px; background-color: #bbb; border-radius: 50%; display: inline-block; transition: background-color 0.3s ease; } .protocol-dot.active { background-color: #333; } .protocol-dot:hover { background-color: #666; } Your browser does not support the video tag. Critical Evaluation The action produced a noticeable discomfort, but the short duration limited the depth of the experience. Most passersby ignored my presence, revealing how normalized these hostile elements are in the urban landscape. While the prototype exposed indifference and raised questions about belonging in public space, the intervention could be strengthened by extending the time, allowing the body to accumulate visible fatigue, and increasing the friction between the human body and the architectural hostility. Action 2: Returning Life Hypothesis If beauty depends on controlling nature, then reintroducing small forms of life can expose this illusion of cleanliness. Prototype I planted small cuttings of Kalanchoe beharensis in highly controlled spaces: dried planters, concrete corners, hotel entrances. I visited the sites 24 hours later to observe their fate. WHY To challenge the idea that beauty depends on controlling or sterilizing nature. By reintroducing small, resilient plants into spaces designed to exclude life, I test how a gentle biological intervention can shift the meaning of \"cleanliness,\" \"care,\" and \"maintenance\" in the city. WHERE Empty or dried planters, hyper-urbanized streets with only concrete, lifeless corners near restaurants or hotels, and areas where nature is restricted to decorative formats. These sites emphasize the contrast between decorative nature and spontaneous life. HOW Using cuttings of Kalanchoe beharensis, a plant capable of propagating from fallen leaves, I discreetly place small pieces in locations where vegetation has been removed or cannot thrive. The action is symbolic and subtle. I document placements with photographs before and after, noting how even a small form of life reconfigures the space's atmosphere and meaning. PROTOCOL \u2014 Action 2: Returning Life 1. Site Selection (strategic choice) Select urban spaces where life has been removed or suppressed for aesthetic or commercial reasons: Empty planters (especially those maintained by restaurants or hotels) Entrances of hotels and terraces Concrete-dominated sidewalks with no vegetation Corners, cracks, and edges where spontaneous plants are regularly eliminated These sites make visible the tension between aesthetic maintenance and biological persistence. 2. Plant Selection (symbolic decision) I used Kalanchoe beharensis, a plant known for propagating from its own leaves. Its biology makes it a metaphor for resistance: life that reappears even when removed. I carried: a small cup with soil several leaves/cuttings from the plant my phone for documentation 3. Preparation (simple but intentional) I walked with the plant pieces and the soil cup inside my bag During the walk, I chose a few specific sites based on their sterility or performative cleanliness I limited the number of plants I placed because I didn't want to harm the mother plant The action remained discreet and minimal, aligned with the fragility of the gesture 4. Action Implementation (the planting gesture) At each chosen site: I looked for a small corner where the plant might survive I poured a small amount of soil using the cup I placed one Kalanchoe leaf into the soil I took before and after photos with my phone I stayed for a while to observe how people interacted with the space The action introduced life where life had been rejected, not as decoration, but as quiet defiance. 5. Documentation (what actually happened) Before image: barren, hard, or neglected space After image: a single plant disrupting the sterility Return visit (next day): The plant placed outside a hotel had disappeared The plant in the empty planter was pushed to the corner, without soil, surrounded by cigarette butts Four other plants remained intact and strong At the empty planter, I observed several people notice the plant and deliberately avoid stepping on it This documentation reveals social and spatial hierarchies of tolerance toward nonhuman life. 6. Post-Action Reflection The hotel entrance immediately removed the plant, making clear its intolerance toward unscripted nature and its prioritization of a controlled aesthetic The planter filled with cigarette butts showed how public neglect coexists with aesthetic regulation\u2014life is allowed only when ornamental The four surviving plants demonstrated that nature persists despite infrastructural hostility Most strikingly, some passersby instinctively protected the plant, subtly shifting their movement. A tiny piece of life changed how bodies navigated space, revealing an empathy that the architecture itself denies 7. Result This action exposed how urban beauty is selective: It protects certain forms of life, erases others, and remains indifferent to the rest. Planting a single leaf became a method for revealing what the city immediately rejects, what it tolerates, and what it unconsciously protects. \u2190 Previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Next \u2192 let protocolIndex2 = 1; showProtocol2(protocolIndex2); function plusProtocol2(n) { showProtocol2(protocolIndex2 += n); } function currentProtocol2(n) { showProtocol2(protocolIndex2 = n); } function showProtocol2(n) { let i; let cards = document.getElementsByClassName(\"protocol-card-2\"); let dots = document.getElementsByClassName(\"protocol-dot-2\"); if (n > cards.length) {protocolIndex2 = 1} if (n < 1) {protocolIndex2 = cards.length} for (i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) { cards[i].style.display = \"none\"; } for (i = 0; i < dots.length; i++) { dots[i].className = dots[i].className.replace(\" active-2\", \"\"); } if (cards[protocolIndex2-1]) { cards[protocolIndex2-1].style.display = \"block\"; } if (dots[protocolIndex2-1]) { dots[protocolIndex2-1].className += \" active-2\"; } } .protocol-card-2 { display: none; padding: 2rem; background: white; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border: 1px solid #e1e4e8; } .protocol-card-2.active-2 { display: block; } .protocol-dot-2 { cursor: pointer; height: 12px; width: 12px; background-color: #bbb; border-radius: 50%; display: inline-block; transition: background-color 0.3s ease; } .protocol-dot-2.active-2 { background-color: #333; } .protocol-dot-2:hover { background-color: #666; } Your browser does not support the video tag. Critical Evaluation The results varied: some plants remained untouched and subtly protected by pedestrians, while others were removed within hours. This contrast revealed how maintenance practices prioritize cleanliness over spontaneous life. The intervention exposed the fragility of non-human presence in hyper-controlled environments. To expand its critical potential, future iterations could introduce life directly into more \"forbidden\" surfaces, such as spikes or tight architectural gaps, revealing how design suppresses even the possibility of growth. Action 3: Wearing Hostility Hypothesis If hostile architecture is invisible on buildings, then translating its form to the body will expose its violence. Prototype I modified a dress using zip-ties to mimic anti-homeless and anti-pigeon design. I walked through busy urban areas to document reactions. WHY To make visible the violence embedded in hostile architecture by translating it onto the human body. Spikes, ties, and deterrent mechanisms often go unnoticed when placed on buildings, but become unsettling when worn by a person. By embodying these hostile forms, the action reveals how normalized, and invisible, architectural violence has become, and how differently it is perceived when directed at a human body rather than an unwanted presence. WHERE The action was carried out along La Rambla, Parc de la Ciutadella, and the surrounding pedestrian and touristic areas, spaces where visibility, movement, and aesthetic control converge. These highly circulated zones, curated for tourism and public display, become ideal sites for confronting the contrast between architectural hostility and human vulnerability. HOW I modified a dress by attaching zip ties along the sleeves, waist, front, and back, echoing the visual language of anti-homeless barriers and anti-pigeon deterrents. Wearing this outfit, I walked at a normal pace through La Rambla, Parc de la Ciutadella, and nearby pedestrian streets. My presence was not performative; the outfit itself generated the friction. PROTOCOL \u2014 Action 3: Wearing Hostility 1. Site Selection (strategic choice) I selected highly visible, crowded environments that stage a curated image of Barcelona, spaces where beauty, tourism, and regulation converge. The action took place along: La Rambla Parc de la Ciutadella Surrounding pedestrian and touristic streets These areas maximize the contrast between a designed, orderly urban aesthetic and the unsettling presence of a human body embodying architectural hostility. 2. Outfit Creation (conceptual and material decisions) I modified a simple dress by attaching zip ties across the sleeves, waist, front, and back These echo the formal language of anti-homeless barriers and anti-pigeon deterrents They are symbolic rather than harmful, referencing the city's defensive aesthetic while remaining wearable The intention was not to create a costume, but to transform the body into a surface carrying the same visual hostility normally applied to unwanted life. 3. Preparation (logistics and documentation) I dressed with the modified dress and got ready to begin the action I prepared my phone for short video recordings and still images I chose walking routes with consistent pedestrian flow to ensure real public interaction I defined the action as a continuous walk, not a performance, allowing reactions to emerge naturally No assistants or props were used beyond the camera 4. Action Implementation (embodied intervention) Wearing the modified dress, I walked slowly and naturally through La Rambla, Parc de la Ciutadella, and nearby streets I did not act, pose, or seek attention; the tension emerged entirely from the outfit's presence within the urban environment I recorded short clips of my movement and captured moments where the outfit contrasted with the surroundings I allowed passersby to react freely without engaging with them, letting the city respond to the embodied hostility 5. Documentation (multi-layered capture) Documentation included: Photos of the outfit in context Short videos while walking Notes written immediately after the walk describing reactions Observations of how my body was perceived differently in touristic vs. park settings The documentation focused on how the body became both an object and a disruptor of the city's visual order. 6. Post-Action Reflection Unlike the first action, where the body was mostly ignored, this intervention generated many visible reactions People stared, some discretely and others more openly Curiosity, confusion, and discomfort were noticeable The zip ties on the body made hostility impossible to ignore What remains invisible when placed on a building suddenly became intrusive when worn by a person The action revealed that architectural violence is acceptable as long as it targets others, but becomes unsettling when placed on a moving human body. 7. Reflection This action exposed the double standard of urban aesthetics: Hostility is tolerated when built into architecture, invisible in the background of everyday life But becomes socially disruptive when embodied and made visible on a person walking through the city The body wearing hostility became a mirror reflecting the city's hidden violence. \u2190 Previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Next \u2192 let protocolIndex3 = 1; showProtocol3(protocolIndex3); function plusProtocol3(n) { showProtocol3(protocolIndex3 += n); } function currentProtocol3(n) { showProtocol3(protocolIndex3 = n); } function showProtocol3(n) { let i; let cards = document.getElementsByClassName(\"protocol-card-3\"); let dots = document.getElementsByClassName(\"protocol-dot-3\"); if (n > cards.length) {protocolIndex3 = 1} if (n < 1) {protocolIndex3 = cards.length} for (i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) { cards[i].style.display = \"none\"; } for (i = 0; i < dots.length; i++) { dots[i].className = dots[i].className.replace(\" active-3\", \"\"); } if (cards[protocolIndex3-1]) { cards[protocolIndex3-1].style.display = \"block\"; } if (dots[protocolIndex3-1]) { dots[protocolIndex3-1].className += \" active-3\"; } } .protocol-card-3 { display: none; padding: 2rem; background: white; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border: 1px solid #e1e4e8; } .protocol-card-3.active-3 { display: block; } .protocol-dot-3 { cursor: pointer; height: 12px; width: 12px; background-color: #bbb; border-radius: 50%; display: inline-block; transition: background-color 0.3s ease; } .protocol-dot-3.active-3 { background-color: #333; } .protocol-dot-3:hover { background-color: #666; } Your browser does not support the video tag. Critical Evaluation This prototype generated the strongest reactions. The gesture of embodying hostility made the violence of urban design visible, producing discomfort, glances, and avoidance from strangers. It showed how hostility is tolerated when directed at non-human bodies but becomes unsettling when applied to a human one. The action opens possibilities for deeper engagement, sustained presence, slower movement, or indirect forms of interaction, that could intensify the social friction and expose more clearly the relational dynamics of exclusion. ACT COLLECTIVELY Conceptual Statement This collective action investigates how exclusion operates not only on humans but on other species whose presence has been systematically discouraged in the city. Hostile architecture in Barcelona, especially spikes, have reshaped the behavior and movement of pigeons, pushing them out of commercial streets and central urban infrastructures. This action asks: What happens when hospitality is reintroduced into a space historically designed to reject non-human life? Through a two-phase intervention on a public bench in Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, I test whether human-designed hostility can be reversed, and whether pigeons, treated as \"urban pests\", can reclaim a space made temporarily welcoming. The project seeks not to force interaction but to observe relational dynamics: trust, avoidance, memory, and the long-term effects of spatial violence. The objective is to understand coexistence not as something humans grant, but as a process that requires time, reciprocity, and the agency of non-human partners Action Strategy The collective action unfolds in two contrasting phases, revealing how design shapes multispecies relationships. Phase 1 \u2014 Softness Interrupted A soft cushion is transformed into a hostile object using metal wire, mimicking the logic of anti-homeless and anti-pigeon spikes. Placed on a public bench, the object generates discomfort, confusion, and curiosity among passersby. The goal is to expose the violence embedded in familiar urban objects once their comfort is removed. Phase 2 \u2014 Softness Restored The wire is removed. Breadcrumbs are placed gently on the cushion, turning it into a symbolic invitation for pigeons to rest and feed. This phase tests whether temporary hospitality can counteract long-term exclusion, and whether pigeons feel safe enough to accept the invitation. Why this strategy The two phases create a narrative arc: Humans experience discomfort when hostility affects something meant to be soft. Pigeons reveal the deeper impact of exclusion through their absence, hesitation, or refusal to return. This approach centers horizontal multispecies ethics : no coercion, no forcing of participation, no extraction. The pigeons choose their response, and their choice becomes the core of the action. PROTOCOL \u2014 Collective Action 1. Site Selection (strategic choice) The action takes place in Jardins de la Reina Vict\u00f2ria, along Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, because this area combines: Benches frequently used by pedestrians Clear examples of hostile architecture A constant but not overwhelming flow of people Nearby birds that occasionally visit but still avoid human-modified surfaces This site allows the action to be visible without creating obstruction, and its proximity to transit increases the diversity of reactions. 2. Materials 1 fabric cushion Thin metal wire (0.6 mm) Smartphone for discreet video recording Breadcrumbs 3. Preparation of the Artifact Insert the metal wire directly into the cushion's fabric cover, creating small arched spikes across the surface The wire pierces the inner layer but does not visibly damage the exterior The arches sit above the surface, making the cushion visibly uncomfortable while maintaining structural integrity Ensure the arches cover the entire cushion evenly so that discomfort is clear from any angle PHASE 1 \u2014 Hostile Cushion (30 minutes) 4. Placement Place the wire-modified cushion at the center of the bench, making it immediately noticeable as an intentionally altered object. 5. Position for Documentation Sit on a bench directly facing the intervention site. Hold the smartphone discreetly on your lap or inside your bag to record continuously without disrupting the natural behavior of passersby. 6. Observation Observe: Glances Hesitations People approaching or touching the cushion People redirecting their path People ignoring it altogether You note reactions mentally, focusing on behavior shifts created by the hostile object. 7. Documentation Record the full 30 minutes in one continuous shot. Your presence remains passive and observant. PHASE 2 \u2014 Invitation Cushion (30 minutes) 8. Transformation Remove all wire arches from the cushion, restoring its softness and readability as a normal resting object. 9. Preparation Spread breadcrumbs across the entire surface of the cushion, covering it evenly so that birds can land and feed without needing to search specific points. 10. Re-Placement Place the softened cushion back on the same bench to maintain continuity of the action. (If no birds appear in this area, move to a second location\u2014Pla\u00e7a Catalunya\u2014and place the cushion on a bench under a tree where birds frequently perch.) 11. Observation From the same seated position facing the cushion, observe: Whether birds notice the breadcrumbs Whether they descend or choose not to engage How humans react to the altered context and to the presence (or absence) of birds 12. Documentation Record discreetly for the entire duration, focusing on the contrast between human and non-human interaction patterns with the now-welcoming cushion. 13. Closing the Action After both phases, collect all materials carefully. Leave no breadcrumbs or wire behind, restoring the bench and surrounding area to its original state. \u2190 Previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 Next \u2192 let protocolIndex4 = 1; showProtocol4(protocolIndex4); function plusProtocol4(n) { showProtocol4(protocolIndex4 += n); } function currentProtocol4(n) { showProtocol4(protocolIndex4 = n); } function showProtocol4(n) { let i; let cards = document.getElementsByClassName(\"protocol-card-4\"); let dots = document.getElementsByClassName(\"protocol-dot-4\"); if (n > cards.length) {protocolIndex4 = 1} if (n < 1) {protocolIndex4 = cards.length} for (i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) { cards[i].style.display = \"none\"; } for (i = 0; i < dots.length; i++) { dots[i].className = dots[i].className.replace(\" active-4\", \"\"); } if (cards[protocolIndex4-1]) { cards[protocolIndex4-1].style.display = \"block\"; } if (dots[protocolIndex4-1]) { dots[protocolIndex4-1].className += \" active-4\"; } } .protocol-card-4 { display: none; padding: 2rem; background: white; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border: 1px solid #e1e4e8; } .protocol-card-4.active-4 { display: block; } .protocol-dot-4 { cursor: pointer; height: 12px; width: 12px; background-color: #bbb; border-radius: 50%; display: inline-block; transition: background-color 0.3s ease; } .protocol-dot-4.active-4 { background-color: #333; } .protocol-dot-4:hover { background-color: #666; } Activation of an Affective Relationship with the Collective Why pigeons? Pigeons are one of the most heavily excluded species in Barcelona's urban landscape. Spikes, nets, sloped surfaces, chemical deterrents, and architectural modifications are designed specifically to reduce their presence, despite their long history of coexistence with humans. Pigeons are: Resilient urban dwellers Deeply affected by hostile design Socially intelligent animals with complex navigation and learning behaviors A species whose presence reflects the ecological health of cities They are not a metaphor for exclusion, they experience it daily. How I contribute By transforming a bench into a temporary site of hospitality, I challenge the urban logic that treats pigeons as undesirable I create a space where pigeons might feel safe again, without forcing their participation I document their reactions (or refusals) as a legitimate form of agency and communication I acknowledge that coexistence requires time and trust, not just design gestures Why they need this activation The action highlights how deeply exclusion has shaped their behavior. Even when offered food and a safe surface, pigeons in hostile zones may no longer approach the ground. Hostile design has altered not only where they move, but how they perceive human-made objects. This activation is needed not to \"help pigeons,\" but to make visible their learned avoidance, their adaptations, and their survival strategies. Collective objectives (not only mine) To create temporary multispecies spaces where pigeons are not repelled To foster awareness of the ecological and ethical implications of hostile design To recognize pigeons' agency in deciding whether to engage To question the anthropocentric assumption that hospitality can be instantly restored To build relational sensitivity between humans and urban non-human species This is not an aesthetic intervention, it is an invitation to reconsider coexistence.

I entered the project believing that removing the wire and offering softness, food, and a safe surface might be enough to re-open a space for pigeons, one of the most excluded species in Barcelona\u2019s urban landscape. But their refusal to approach, even when the bench was inviting, showed me that design does not only shape bodies; it shapes memory, behavior, and trust. The pigeons became my collective not because they could perform something for the project, but because they already live inside the violence I am studying. Their everyday routes are marked by spikes, nets, slope systems and deterrents that have gradually redefined what is safe for them. In this sense, they were not subjects of my experiment, they were partners whose decisions revealed truths that humans often overlook. Their absence in Phase 2 was not a failure; it was a message. A response. A form of communication. It showed that exclusion accumulates. That being welcomed once does not erase years of being pushed away. That coexistence demands more than design gestures; it requires continuity, patience, and relational repair. It also reminded me that non-human agency does not always appear as interaction. Sometimes it appears as withdrawal, caution, or doubt. Through this action, I learned to recognize pigeons not as symbols of urban \u201cdirt\u201d but as sentient urban inhabitants navigating a city structured against them. Their behavior made visible the long-term impact of hostile architecture in a way that no human-focused intervention could. The collective objective, then, was not to make pigeons \u201creturn,\u201d but to reveal how the city has taught them not to. The action ends with an unanswered invitation, a cushion that remained soft, full of food, yet untouched. And that unanswered space is meaningful: it is the gap between intention and trust, between a gesture of hospitality and the lived memory of violence. This project does not conclude with success or failure. It concludes with a deeper understanding: that to act collectively with non-human partners is to listen to their silences, respect their decisions, and recognize that care is a slow process, not a spectacle. Coexistence is not granted by design, it is negotiated over time, through attention, vulnerability, and an ethics of more-than-human respect.","title":"Studio"},{"location":"term1/01-Bootcamp/","text":"MDEF Projects About me Bootcamp \u00b6 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
