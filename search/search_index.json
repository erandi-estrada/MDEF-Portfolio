To be judge \u00b6 We played a game of surveillance, half of us became subjects, half became detectives. For thirty minutes, I was followed without knowing by whom, and for another thirty, I became the one who watched. The constant awareness of being seen changed the way I moved, the way I existed. Subject My prototype was my own hair. I usually keep it tied with a hair clip, but this time I let it loose, it became my prosthesis, my shield. The idea of someone following me made me feel anxious, so hiding from my own Detective behind myself seemed like the only thing I could control. The surveillance started at 12:17. Some of us went to the rooftop, but the sun was too bright so after a few minutes I went downstairs, trying to shake off the feeling of being observed. My original plan was to stay still, to be boring and pretend it was a normal day, but the discomfort pushed me to move. So I ran away from my detective and wandered without direction, not knowing where to go. By 12:40, I returned to IAAC and ran into Ale and Aishwarya. We walked together toward the coffee shop and then back to the classroom. Even though I know my phone listens, that cameras watch from every corner, that I'm theoretically being observed all the time, knowing that someone was actually following me was completely different. It made the abstract fear tangible. I felt panic rise in moments I couldn't explain, and even after I lost my Detective, I couldn't shake the feeling of being pursued. Detective As the detective, I tried to be discreet, to observe without being noticed, but quickly realized it was harder than I imagined. At 13:02, the subject was deeply focused on the computer with Armin, likely working on something related to the webpage. By 13:11, the subject closed the laptop, returned to her seat, and put some items in her locker. At 13:12, she went downstairs, and I immediately lost track of her. I walked around the building and the surrounding areas, trying to find her again without being noticed, but she seemed to have disappeared for a while. Since the subject suggested continuing the game, I followed once more. At 14:01, she joined a group on the terrace with Ayal, Max, and Armin, excited to try a new game of Armin's. She ate some pasta, and throughout those moments, she shared music, recommending \"Cosa sar\u00e0\" for sad moments, \"Cumbia japonesa\" for cooking, \"Ella baila sola\" for parties, and choosing bossa nova to manage stress, even though she confessed she would have preferred techno. Each song revealed a different version of the subject, a small window into her moods, habits, and how she navigates everyday life. Trying not to be obvious, I attempted to stay discreet, but the subject quickly realized I was the one following her. Once I lost track of her, I had to ask around and search through her nearby circle to try to find her, which made it clear that discretion alone was ineffective. The exercise showed how challenging it is to be a silent observer, and how quickly the balance of watching can shift, revealing both the watcher and the watched. #eye-emoji { position: fixed; font-size: 40px; z-index: 10000; pointer-events: none; opacity: 1; padding: 5px; } /* Estilo para los enlaces */ a { color: #1976d2; text-decoration: none; } a:hover { text-decoration: underline; } document.addEventListener('mousemove', function(e) { let eye = document.getElementById('eye-emoji'); if (!eye) { eye = document.createElement('div'); eye.id = 'eye-emoji'; eye.textContent = '\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f'; document.body.appendChild(eye); } eye.style.left = (e.clientX - 20) + 'px'; eye.style.top = (e.clientY - 20) + 'px'; });","title":"Prosthesis"},{"location":"Prosthesis/Prosthesis/#becoming-prosthetic","text":"To be the best version of ourselves once sounded like an act of progress, a cleaner, faster, optimized human.

The MacBook is a portable computing device designed to process information, display visual output, and allow users to interact with digital content through its screen, keyboard, camera, trackpad, and built-in media and connectivity ports. How does it work? Mechanical: The MacBook\u2019s mechanical systems support and protect its internal components. The hinge allows the screen to open and close, the keyboard uses pressure switches to register input, the trackpad uses a rigid surface over a sensor layer, and the cooling system uses a fan and to move heat away from the processor. The case holds all components in alignment and enables physical interaction. Electrical: The MacBook operates through interconnected electrical systems. Power flows from the battery and power adapter through voltage regulators to the logic board, where circuits distribute energy to the CPU, memory, storage, display, and other parts of the computer. Electrical signals move between components via buses, connectors, and wiring, enabling communication between sensors, input devices, and processing hardware. Digital: Digital operation is handled by firmware and software that translate user actions into computational tasks. The operating system coordinates memory, processes input, manages storage, and controls the display. Embedded controllers interpret keyboard and trackpad signals, while system firmware initializes hardware and manages low-level logic. Together, these digital layers enable the MacBook to run applications, process data, and execute user commands. Construction & Failure How is it built? The MacBook is assembled primarily with small screws that secure a plastic top and bottom cases to an internal frame. The top case integrates the keyboard and trackpad as a single unit mounted above the main internal components. Inside, beneath the keyboard and trackpad, are the optical drive, battery, RAM modules, fan, and hard-drive bay. The lowest layer contains the logic board, wireless cards, and the cooling system, with everything connected through cables and board-to-board connectors. The logic board also holds all external input/output ports, such as USB, audio, Ethernet, power, and video-out, which are accessible along the side of the chassis. The display assembly consists of the LCD panel, backlight, camera module, and wiring harness enclosed within the lid. This assembly is wired to the logic board through the edges of the computer, which was incredibly frustrating to remove without breaking it. Why did it fail? Our best guess is that the computer became obsolete because the batteries stopped working. We weren\u2019t able to get a power cable to try charging it, but when we separated the battery from the computer, we noticed it was slightly swollen. We decided to open it to check the components, and it turned out that only 1 of the 6 cells was swollen. We tried measuring the voltage with a multimeter and, as expected, the cells were no longer functioning. We also found a lot of lint and dust inside the computer, which may have contributed to a decrease in performance. Component Testing \u00b6 Hard Drive Recovery \u00b6 WHY To explore data recovery possibilities and demonstrate how much personal information remains accessible on discarded devices, highlighting digital security concerns. HOW Connected the 160GB Fujitsu hard drive to a modern Apple laptop via external adapter, successfully accessing stored data including personal files and user information. RESULT Successfully recovered data, identifying the original owner. This revealed significant privacy implications of improper device disposal. Fan Control Hack \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. WHY To understand motor control and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) principles while repurposing a functional component. HOW Used Barduino board with Arduino IDE, requiring pin extraction, transistor integration, and custom wiring to achieve variable speed control. RESULT Successfully controlled fan speed through Arduino code after overcoming wiring challenges and voltage requirements. Trackpad Conversion Attempt \u00b6 WHY To convert the MacBook trackpad into an USB USB trackpad, exploring component repurposing. HOW Followed online tutorials to identify pins and solder USB cable directly to the trackpad board. RESULT Despite proper soldering, the trackpad wasn't recognized by computers. Provided valuable soldering practice and component understanding. Display Screen Testing \u00b6 WHY Despite knowing through research and advice from instructors that the display screen would be relatively difficult to hack into, we still wanted to give it a try since it was one of the components we were most excited about its potential. HOW We started by trying to connect the inverter board to a power source to attempt to light up the screen. The inverter board converts low-voltage DC to high-voltage AC, provides constant current to the CCFL tube and controls on/off and brightness. We discovered the screen uses Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp (CCFL) not LED, so the inverter board had 4 identical wires for GND, power input, BL_ENABLE (on/off), and BL_DIM (brightness) which needed 2 power supplies and trial to identify which wire is for which. RESULT After connecting the inverter to the power source we tried every cable with 12V, but unfortunately it didn't turn on. The complexity of CCFL technology and the specific voltage requirements made this component particularly challenging to reactivate.

Our public spaces perform perfection while silencing life. They are stage sets, not ecosystems. Benches deny rest, walls erase voices, and spikes replace sanctuary.This is not design for people; it is design against life. It decides who belongs, and who must disappear. It declares what is clean by violently excluding what it calls dirty. Therefore, we must see this order for what it is: violence disguised as aesthetics. If beauty requires exclusion, then it is not beauty. It is a system of exclusion. Comfort for a few always requires discomfort for the many. Conceptual Definition Urban beauty often appears neutral: clean lines, polished surfaces, controlled vegetation. However, this project argues that such beauty operates as a system of exclusion. In Barcelona, benches, facades, and even landscaping participate in a spatial order that determines who may sit, pause, appear, or exist. Violence here is subtle: not physical force, but the systematic removal of discomfort, disorder, and \"undesired\" beings, humans, plants or birds. This work intervenes in those silent boundaries. Through embodied actions, I test what happens when the excluded returns: a body resting where it shouldn't, a plant growing where it isn't allowed, a person wearing the hostile architecture meant to repel them. The objective is not to fix the city, but to reveal its underlying logic: beauty as discipline, and life as resistance. Action 1: The Prohibited Rest \u00b6 WHY To expose how public space quietly discourages rest by transforming design into a mechanism of control. By placing my body in spaces intentionally made uncomfortable, I test how beauty operates as a disciplinary tool that sanitizes the city by removing undesired presence. WHERE Ledges with spikes and other anti-rest modifications found outside hotels, shops, and restaurants, areas where maintaining a \"clean\" and orderly image is prioritized for customers and tourists. These sites make visible how private commercial interests shape the public experience of the city. HOW I sit for a fixed period of 10 minutes in each location, placing my body in direct friction with surfaces designed to repel it. I document the action using time-lapse video and photographs, observing both my own discomfort and the reactions, often indifference, of passersby. My body becomes a temporary disruption in a space optimized for circulation, not rest. PROTOCOL \u2014 Action 1: The Prohibited Rest \u00b6 1. Site Selection (strategic choice) Choose locations where hostile design is used to expel both humans and nonhuman life. In this action, the focus is on: Ledges and surfaces with spikes for people (anti-rest architecture) Edges and structures with spikes for pigeons (anti-animal architecture) Places where both types of spikes coexist Sites with high visibility and continuous flow of people Selected areas: La Rambla (tourist corridor, high circulation) Parc de la Ciutadella (public leisure space) Plazas and busy intersections Entrances of hotels, shops, and restaurants that prioritize \"clean image\" These locations maximize friction between \"beauty,\" control, and everyday behavior. 2. Pre-Observation (context study) Before sitting, visit each site to observe: How people move through the space Whether anyone uses the surface despite the spikes How spikes are incorporated into the aesthetic of the building How human and nonhuman presence is regulated Note mentally how the architecture shapes acceptable behavior. 3. Preparation (logistics + documentation) Wear neutral clothing to avoid performing a character Choose a discreet angle to place the phone for time-lapse recording Identify exact spots where spikes are present Decide on a fixed duration: 10 minutes per site Plan to write reflections immediately after each action No notebooks, props, or conspicuous recording tools 4. Action Implementation (embodied presence) Sit directly on or beside surfaces where spikes are installed Keep a relaxed, natural posture, simply be there Remain in place for 10 minutes, regardless of discomfort Do not engage with passersby unless approached Let the body become the site of tension between design and presence 5. Documentation (strategic) Time-lapse video capturing your presence in a hostile space Close-up photos of spikes intended for humans and pigeons Wide shots of the site to contextualize its beauty/performance Quick field notes after each action (written in your phone): Emotional reactions Physical discomfort Social reactions (glances, avoidance, indifference) Environmental context (noise, flow, weather) All documentation focuses on revealing the contrast between beauty and exclusion. 6. Post-Action Reflection (after the site visit) Guiding questions: Did anyone notice or react? How? Did the discomfort remain invisible to most people? How does hostility hide behind \"cleanliness\"? What forms of exclusion remain unquestioned in daily life? What did the spikes communicate about who belongs in that space? Reflect on how violence can be aesthetic, normalized, and unnoticed. 7. Reflection Very few people noticed me. Most walked past indifferently, as if my presence didn't belong or wasn't worth registering. When someone did look, it was quickly, more confusion than concern. The architecture succeeded: I felt out of place. My presence revealed that hostility does not need enforcement; design performs its own violence quietly. \u2190 Previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Next \u2192 let protocolIndex = 1; showProtocol(protocolIndex); function plusProtocol(n) { showProtocol(protocolIndex += n); } function currentProtocol(n) { showProtocol(protocolIndex = n); } function showProtocol(n) { let i; let cards = document.getElementsByClassName(\"protocol-card\"); let dots = document.getElementsByClassName(\"protocol-dot\"); if (n > cards.length) {protocolIndex = 1} if (n < 1) {protocolIndex = cards.length} for (i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) { cards[i].style.display = \"none\"; } for (i = 0; i < dots.length; i++) { dots[i].className = dots[i].className.replace(\" active\", \"\"); } cards[protocolIndex-1].style.display = \"block\"; dots[protocolIndex-1].className += \" active\"; } .protocol-card { display: none; padding: 2rem; background: white; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border: 1px solid #e1e4e8; } .protocol-card.active { display: block; } .protocol-dot { cursor: pointer; height: 12px; width: 12px; background-color: #bbb; border-radius: 50%; display: inline-block; transition: background-color 0.3s ease; } .protocol-dot.active { background-color: #333; } .protocol-dot:hover { background-color: #666; } Your browser does not support the video tag. Action 2: Returning Life \u00b6 WHY To challenge the idea that beauty depends on controlling or sterilizing nature. By reintroducing small, resilient plants into spaces designed to exclude life, I test how a gentle biological intervention can shift the meaning of \"cleanliness,\" \"care,\" and \"maintenance\" in the city. WHERE Empty or dried planters, hyper-urbanized streets with only concrete, lifeless corners near restaurants or hotels, and areas where nature is restricted to decorative formats. These sites emphasize the contrast between decorative nature and spontaneous life. HOW Using cuttings of Kalanchoe beharensis, a plant capable of propagating from fallen leaves, I discreetly place small pieces in locations where vegetation has been removed or cannot thrive. The action is symbolic and subtle. I document placements with photographs before and after, noting how even a small form of life reconfigures the space's atmosphere and meaning. PROTOCOL \u2014 Action 2: Returning Life \u00b6 1. Site Selection (strategic choice) Select urban spaces where life has been removed or suppressed for aesthetic or commercial reasons: Empty planters (especially those maintained by restaurants or hotels) Entrances of hotels and terraces Concrete-dominated sidewalks with no vegetation Corners, cracks, and edges where spontaneous plants are regularly eliminated These sites make visible the tension between aesthetic maintenance and biological persistence. 2. Plant Selection (symbolic decision) I used Kalanchoe beharensis, a plant known for propagating from its own leaves. Its biology makes it a metaphor for resistance: life that reappears even when removed. I carried: a small cup with soil several leaves/cuttings from the plant my phone for documentation 3. Preparation (simple but intentional) I walked with the plant pieces and the soil cup inside my bag During the walk, I chose a few specific sites based on their sterility or performative cleanliness I limited the number of plants I placed because I didn't want to harm the mother plant The action remained discreet and minimal, aligned with the fragility of the gesture 4. Action Implementation (the planting gesture) At each chosen site: I looked for a small corner where the plant might survive I poured a small amount of soil using the cup I placed one Kalanchoe leaf into the soil I took before and after photos with my phone I stayed for a while to observe how people interacted with the space The action introduced life where life had been rejected, not as decoration, but as quiet defiance. 5. Documentation (what actually happened) Before image: barren, hard, or neglected space After image: a single plant disrupting the sterility Return visit (next day): The plant placed outside a hotel had disappeared The plant in the empty planter was pushed to the corner, without soil, surrounded by cigarette butts Four other plants remained intact and strong At the empty planter, I observed several people notice the plant and deliberately avoid stepping on it This documentation reveals social and spatial hierarchies of tolerance toward nonhuman life. 6. Post-Action Reflection The hotel entrance immediately removed the plant, making clear its intolerance toward unscripted nature and its prioritization of a controlled aesthetic The planter filled with cigarette butts showed how public neglect coexists with aesthetic regulation\u2014life is allowed only when ornamental The four surviving plants demonstrated that nature persists despite infrastructural hostility Most strikingly, some passersby instinctively protected the plant, subtly shifting their movement. A tiny piece of life changed how bodies navigated space, revealing an empathy that the architecture itself denies 7. Result This action exposed how urban beauty is selective: It protects certain forms of life, erases others, and remains indifferent to the rest. Planting a single leaf became a method for revealing what the city immediately rejects, what it tolerates, and what it unconsciously protects. \u2190 Previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Next \u2192 let protocolIndex2 = 1; showProtocol2(protocolIndex2); function plusProtocol2(n) { showProtocol2(protocolIndex2 += n); } function currentProtocol2(n) { showProtocol2(protocolIndex2 = n); } function showProtocol2(n) { let i; let cards = document.getElementsByClassName(\"protocol-card-2\"); let dots = document.getElementsByClassName(\"protocol-dot-2\"); if (n > cards.length) {protocolIndex2 = 1} if (n < 1) {protocolIndex2 = cards.length} for (i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) { cards[i].style.display = \"none\"; } for (i = 0; i < dots.length; i++) { dots[i].className = dots[i].className.replace(\" active-2\", \"\"); } if (cards[protocolIndex2-1]) { cards[protocolIndex2-1].style.display = \"block\"; } if (dots[protocolIndex2-1]) { dots[protocolIndex2-1].className += \" active-2\"; } } .protocol-card-2 { display: none; padding: 2rem; background: white; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border: 1px solid #e1e4e8; } .protocol-card-2.active-2 { display: block; } .protocol-dot-2 { cursor: pointer; height: 12px; width: 12px; background-color: #bbb; border-radius: 50%; display: inline-block; transition: background-color 0.3s ease; } .protocol-dot-2.active-2 { background-color: #333; } .protocol-dot-2:hover { background-color: #666; } Your browser does not support the video tag. Action 3: Wearing Hostility \u00b6 WHY To make visible the violence embedded in hostile architecture by translating it onto the human body. Spikes, ties, and deterrent mechanisms often go unnoticed when placed on buildings, but become unsettling when worn by a person. By embodying these hostile forms, the action reveals how normalized, and invisible, architectural violence has become, and how differently it is perceived when directed at a human body rather than an unwanted presence. WHERE The action was carried out along La Rambla, Parc de la Ciutadella, and the surrounding pedestrian and touristic areas, spaces where visibility, movement, and aesthetic control converge. These highly circulated zones, curated for tourism and public display, become ideal sites for confronting the contrast between architectural hostility and human vulnerability. HOW I modified a dress by attaching zip ties along the sleeves, waist, front, and back, echoing the visual language of anti-homeless barriers and anti-pigeon deterrents. Wearing this outfit, I walked at a normal pace through La Rambla, Parc de la Ciutadella, and nearby pedestrian streets. My presence was not performative; the outfit itself generated the friction. PROTOCOL \u2014 Action 3: Wearing Hostility \u00b6 1. Site Selection (strategic choice) I selected highly visible, crowded environments that stage a curated image of Barcelona, spaces where beauty, tourism, and regulation converge. The action took place along: La Rambla Parc de la Ciutadella Surrounding pedestrian and touristic streets These areas maximize the contrast between a designed, orderly urban aesthetic and the unsettling presence of a human body embodying architectural hostility. 2. Outfit Creation (conceptual and material decisions) I modified a simple dress by attaching zip ties across the sleeves, waist, front, and back These echo the formal language of anti-homeless barriers and anti-pigeon deterrents They are symbolic rather than harmful, referencing the city's defensive aesthetic while remaining wearable The intention was not to create a costume, but to transform the body into a surface carrying the same visual hostility normally applied to unwanted life. 3. Preparation (logistics and documentation) I dressed with the modified dress and got ready to begin the action I prepared my phone for short video recordings and still images I chose walking routes with consistent pedestrian flow to ensure real public interaction I defined the action as a continuous walk, not a performance, allowing reactions to emerge naturally No assistants or props were used beyond the camera 4. Action Implementation (embodied intervention) Wearing the modified dress, I walked slowly and naturally through La Rambla, Parc de la Ciutadella, and nearby streets I did not act, pose, or seek attention; the tension emerged entirely from the outfit's presence within the urban environment I recorded short clips of my movement and captured moments where the outfit contrasted with the surroundings I allowed passersby to react freely without engaging with them, letting the city respond to the embodied hostility 5. Documentation (multi-layered capture) Documentation included: Photos of the outfit in context Short videos while walking Notes written immediately after the walk describing reactions Observations of how my body was perceived differently in touristic vs. park settings The documentation focused on how the body became both an object and a disruptor of the city's visual order. 6. Post-Action Reflection Unlike the first action, where the body was mostly ignored, this intervention generated many visible reactions People stared, some discretely and others more openly Curiosity, confusion, and discomfort were noticeable The zip ties on the body made hostility impossible to ignore What remains invisible when placed on a building suddenly became intrusive when worn by a person The action revealed that architectural violence is acceptable as long as it targets others, but becomes unsettling when placed on a moving human body. 7. Reflection This action exposed the double standard of urban aesthetics: Hostility is tolerated when built into architecture, invisible in the background of everyday life But becomes socially disruptive when embodied and made visible on a person walking through the city The body wearing hostility became a mirror reflecting the city's hidden violence. \u2190 Previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Next \u2192 let protocolIndex3 = 1; showProtocol3(protocolIndex3); function plusProtocol3(n) { showProtocol3(protocolIndex3 += n); } function currentProtocol3(n) { showProtocol3(protocolIndex3 = n); } function showProtocol3(n) { let i; let cards = document.getElementsByClassName(\"protocol-card-3\"); let dots = document.getElementsByClassName(\"protocol-dot-3\"); if (n > cards.length) {protocolIndex3 = 1} if (n < 1) {protocolIndex3 = cards.length} for (i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) { cards[i].style.display = \"none\"; } for (i = 0; i < dots.length; i++) { dots[i].className = dots[i].className.replace(\" active-3\", \"\"); } if (cards[protocolIndex3-1]) { cards[protocolIndex3-1].style.display = \"block\"; } if (dots[protocolIndex3-1]) { dots[protocolIndex3-1].className += \" active-3\"; } } .protocol-card-3 { display: none; padding: 2rem; background: white; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border: 1px solid #e1e4e8; } .protocol-card-3.active-3 { display: block; } .protocol-dot-3 { cursor: pointer; height: 12px; width: 12px; background-color: #bbb; border-radius: 50%; display: inline-block; transition: background-color 0.3s ease; } .protocol-dot-3.active-3 { background-color: #333; } .protocol-dot-3:hover { background-color: #666; } Your browser does not support the video tag.","title":"Studio"},{"location":"studio/studio/#beauty-that-excludes","text":"An embodied research on hostile design, urban aesthetics, and the politics of beauty in Barcelona.
